### HTML  


The HTML is simple and only contains a __form tag__ along with the code for the optional modal.  
The only thing that needs to be edited in the code is to replace the code with your own email address: 

         <form action="https://formspree.io/(YOUREMAIL@WEBSITE.COM)" method="POST">

### CSS

The CSS contains styling for the modal, form and buttons. This is just for demo purposes and is not necessary for functionality of the form.    

---  
### Javascript  

The javascript contains code for the modal for the contact form. It allows for the closing of the modal by clicking the __(x)__, clicking __off__ the form and by pressing the __ESC__ key.
